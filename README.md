First repository!

Hello people of the hub!
My name is Ashley and I've been coding since middle school. 
I code because people told me I couldn't, so of course I did, and now I'm the only person from my high school that graduated to pursue a compsci degree in an US college, thousand miles away from home.

It's totally worth it.
